The app build by ordering process , from the options to the purchase.

* Map view that showing business's location.
* Clients can visit in business's instagram & facebook account from the app. Also send whatsapp message.
* Show the user all the business's services/products.
* Clients can choose the date and time they are interested. (By the business's demand, like two weeks from today).
* Every purchase is saved on the server and automatically deleted after it expires.
* After purchase email will send to the buissnes owner and to the client.
